# Data consiting of 162500/160650 training/test simulated particle collisions and interactions from the ATLAS detector inside CERN's LHC outside Geneva. If we observe data of colliding protons, we're able to distinguish individual electrons which may have spawned from a particle decaying out of the proton. 
# Three tasks at hand: Identify (classification) electrons vs non-electrons, estimate (regression) the energy of the electrons, and cluster the particle signatures into 3+ categories using unsupervised learning. 
# There exists at least one tree baseed solution and one neural net based solution. 
# Certification from the project is included
